This project involves creating a program in C called "fdf" that reads in a landscape model from a .fdf file and renders it in isometric projection. The coordinates of the landscape are stored in the .fdf file, with each number representing a point in space, including its horizontal position, vertical position, and altitude.

After rendering the landscape, the program must display it in a window with smooth window management, allowing users to interact with it easily. Pressing ESC or clicking on the cross on the window's frame should close the window and exit the program cleanly.

The use of MiniLibX, a graphics library, is mandatory for this project. Additionally, there's a bonus part where extra features can be implemented, such as additional projections, zooming in and out, translation, rotation, and one more bonus feature of the developer's choice.

The focus of the project is not on parsing maps but on rendering and displaying them correctly. However, the program should handle properly formatted maps without crashing.</p>
